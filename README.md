FT_PRINTF
📚 Project Overview
FT_PRINTF is a project developed at 42 School to recreate the functionality of the standard printf function in C. This project focuses on understanding variadic functions, formatted output, and improving low-level programming skills.

By implementing FT_PRINTF, you gain hands-on experience in handling various data types, formatting output, and managing edge cases, all while adhering to strict coding standards.

🛠️ Features
The FT_PRINTF function supports the following format specifiers:

%c: Prints a single character.
%s: Prints a string of characters.
%d / %i: Prints a signed integer in decimal format.
%x / %X: Prints an unsigned integer in hexadecimal format (lowercase/uppercase).
%p: Prints a pointer address.
%%: Prints a literal percent sign.
All features are implemented with precision to mimic the behavior of the original printf function as closely as possible.

📈 Achievement

🏆 Grade Achieved: 100% This project meets all mandatory requirements, demonstrating full functionality of the supported format specifiers.
